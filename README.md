# StoicProject

Project in which I searched through twitter posts to find messages or quotes from the four different Roman Stoics as well as Socrates the "father of Western philosophy".
The main puppose is that everyone debates over who is the best Stoic therefore I wanted to look at not only how often are they referenced but also how often they are favorited or retweeted. I did this project using R to gain more experience cleaning and mining data, statistically analyzing, linear modeling as well as visualizations with this language.
