# StoicProject

Project in which I searched through twitter posts to find messages or quotes from the four different Roman Stoics as well as Socrates the "father of Western philosophy".
The main puprpose is that everyone debates over who is the best Stoic there for I wanted to look at not only how are they referenced but also how often they are favorited or retweeted.
